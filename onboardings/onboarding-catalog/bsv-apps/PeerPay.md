## 1. What Is PeerPay?

PeerPay is a peer-to-peer payment application that revolutionizes how individuals send and receive BSV cryptocurrency. Built on the BSV TypeScript SDK infrastructure, PeerPay eliminates the complexity of blockchain addresses by using identity-based payments - simply search for someone by their identity key and send them SATS instantly.

**Key Features:**
- **Identity-Based Payments** - Send money using identity keys instead of complex blockchain addresses
- **Instant Peer Discovery** - Search and find users by their BSV identity
- **SATS Transactions** - Send and receive payments in satoshis (the smallest unit of BSV)
- **Complete Transaction History** - Track all incoming and outgoing payments
- **Payment Dashboard** - Clean interface for managing all your P2P transactions
- **No Intermediaries** - Direct peer-to-peer transfers without third-party involvement
- **Transparent Records** - All transactions recorded on BSV blockchain

**Target Users:** Anyone needing to send or receive BSV payments between individuals - friends splitting bills, family members exchanging money, freelancers receiving payments, or anyone seeking a simple alternative to traditional payment apps with the benefits of blockchain technology.

## 2. Before You Begin

### Prerequisites
- **BSV Wallet:** BSV Desktop Wallet or BRC-100 compatible wallet
- **BSV Identity:** Identity key for receiving payments and user discovery
- **Web Browser:** Modern browser with JavaScript enabled
- **BSV Balance:** SATS for sending payments (minimal amounts for testing)
- **Identity Understanding:** Basic familiarity with BSV identity system (helpful but not required)

### Supported Platforms
- **Web-based:** Access via https://peerpay.babbage.systems/
- **Cross-platform:** Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **BSV SDK Integration:** Compatible with all BRC-100 compatible wallets
- **No Installation Required:** Pure web application

### BRC-100 Identity Setup
PeerPay relies on the BRC-100 identity flow for peer discovery. If you're using BSV Desktop Wallet, your identity is already configured. For other wallets:
- Ensure your wallet supports BSV TypeScript SDK
- Verify your identity key is active
- Share your identity key with people who need to send you payments

## 3. Getting Started: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Access PeerPay
1. Navigate to **https://peerpay.babbage.systems/** in your web browser
2. The PeerPay interface will load
3. Ensure your BSV wallet is running in the background
4. The application will automatically detect your BRC-100 compatible wallet

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet
1. PeerPay will request connection to your BSV wallet
2. **Grant permission** when prompted by your wallet application
3. Your identity key will be linked to PeerPay
4. The main dashboard appears once connected
5. Your current balance and identity status display in the interface

### Step 3: Find a Peer by Identity
1. Locate the **Search** or **Find User** field
2. Enter the recipient's **BSV identity key**
3. The system searches the BRC-100 identity and discovery flow
4. Matching user(s) appear in search results
5. Verify you've selected the correct recipient
6. Click on the user to proceed to payment

**Finding Identity Keys:**
- Recipients can share their identity key directly with you
- Identity keys are unique identifiers in the BSV ecosystem
- Some BSV applications display user identity keys in profiles
- Identity keys are different from blockchain addresses

### Step 4: Send Your First Payment
1. With recipient selected, enter the **payment amount in SATS**
2. Review the payment details:
   - Recipient identity key
   - Amount to send
   - Current network fee (typically very small)
3. Add an optional **payment note or description** if desired
4. Click **Send Payment** or **Confirm**
5. Your wallet prompts for payment authorization
6. **Approve the transaction** in your wallet
7. Payment processes instantly on BSV blockchain
8. Confirmation appears in PeerPay interface

**SATS Conversion:**
- 1 BSV = 100,000,000 SATS
- Example: 10,000 SATS = 0.0001 BSV
- PeerPay displays amounts in SATS for precision

### Step 5: Receive Payments
1. Share your **BSV identity key** with the sender
2. Incoming payments automatically appear in your dashboard
3. No action required to receive - payments arrive automatically
4. Your wallet balance updates in real-time
5. Review incoming payment details in the transaction history

**Sharing Your Identity:**
- Find your identity key in BSV Desktop or your wallet settings
- Share via secure channels (messaging apps, email, etc.)
- Your identity key is safe to share publicly (unlike private keys)
- Consider creating a payment link or QR code for easier sharing

### Step 6: Review Transaction History
1. Access the **Payments Dashboard** or **History** section
2. View complete transaction list with:
   - **Sent payments** - outgoing transactions
   - **Received payments** - incoming transactions
   - Timestamps for all transactions
   - Payment amounts and descriptions
   - Transaction status (pending, confirmed)


**History Features:**
- Filter by date range or transaction type
- Search for specific payments
- Export transaction history for records
- Click transactions for blockchain verification

## 5. Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Cannot find recipient | Invalid identity key | Double-check identity key format; verify recipient has active BRC-100-compatible identity |
| Payment fails to send | Insufficient SATS balance | Check wallet balance; ensure enough SATS to cover amount plus fees |
| Wallet not connecting | BSV wallet not running | Launch BSV Desktop or compatible wallet; refresh PeerPay page |
| Payment stuck pending | Network delay | Wait for blockchain confirmation; BSV typically confirms within minutes |
| Identity search returns no results | Recipient not on BRC-100 wallet ecosystem | Verify recipient uses BRC-100 compatible wallet; check identity key accuracy |
| History not loading | Browser cache issue | Clear browser cache; refresh page; check internet connection |

### Tips for Smooth Transactions
- **Verify Identity Keys:** Always confirm recipient identity before sending
- **Start Small:** Test with small amounts when sending to new recipients
- **Note Descriptions:** Add payment notes for your own record-keeping
- **Network Awareness:** BSV transactions are fast but allow time for blockchain confirmation
- **Balance Management:** Keep sufficient SATS balance for payments and fees
