## 1. What Is MarsCast?

MarsCast is a blockchain-secured API service that delivers real-time Mars weather data and planetary information via pay-per-request micropayments on the BSV blockchain. It demonstrates how API access can be monetized with BSV micropayments while requiring identity verification through CoolCert certificates.

**Key Features:**
- **Mars Weather Data** - Access latest Mars planetary and atmospheric data
- **Pay-Per-Request Model** - Micropayment pricing at $0.001 per API request
- **CoolCert Integration** - Identity verification required for API access
- **Real-Time Data** - Current Mars weather and planetary conditions
- **Blockchain Payments** - Transparent, instant BSV micropayment transactions
- **API Demonstration** - Showcases monetized API access patterns

**Target Users:** Developers learning API monetization with micropayments, educators demonstrating blockchain applications, space enthusiasts accessing Mars data, and anyone interested in pay-per-use API models.

### Step 2: Authenticate with CoolCert
1. MarsCast requires a valid CoolCert identity certificate
2. If you don't have one:
   - Visit [https://coolcert.babbage.systems/](https://coolcert.babbage.systems/)
   - Issue your CoolCert certificate following the [CoolCert guide](./CoolCert.md)
   - Return to MarsCast with your certificate
3. MarsCast will automatically detect your CoolCert identity
4. Grant permission for MarsCast to verify your certificate

### Step 3: Request Mars Weather Data
1. Once authenticated, click **"Fetch Mars Weather"**
2. Review the request cost: **$0.001 (approximately 1,000-2,000 satoshis)**
3. Confirm the micropayment in your BSV wallet
4. API processes your request immediately

### Step 4: View Mars Data
After payment confirmation, you'll receive:
- **Temperature:** Current Mars surface temperature
- **Atmospheric Pressure:** Mars atmospheric conditions
- **Wind Speed:** Mars wind data
- **Sol (Mars Day):** Current Martian day number
- **Season:** Current Martian season
- **Additional Metrics:** Various planetary data points

### Step 5: Review Transaction History
1. View your API request history in MarsCast dashboard
2. Check payment confirmations in BSV Desktop wallet
3. Each request is recorded on the blockchain for transparency
4. Monitor your spending on API calls

## 5. Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Missing certificate error | No CoolCert identity | Visit CoolCert and issue your identity certificate |
| API request fails | Insufficient BSV or connectivity | Check wallet balance; verify internet connection |
| Authentication fails | CoolCert verification issue | Reissue CoolCert certificate; ensure wallet is connected |
| Micropayment status unknown | Blockchain confirmation pending | Wait a few seconds for transaction confirmation |
| Data not loading | Network or API issue | Refresh page; check API status; retry request |

### Important Tips
