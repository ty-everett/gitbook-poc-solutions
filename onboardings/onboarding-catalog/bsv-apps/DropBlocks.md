## 1. What Is DropBlocks?

DropBlocks is a decentralized file storage application built on the BSV blockchain that provides permanent, verifiable file storage using the UHRP (Universal Hash-Resolved Protocol). Unlike traditional cloud storage, your files are stored off-chain with blockchain timestamping for provenance, giving you true ownership and control of your data.

**Key Features:**
- **Decentralized File Storage** - Files stored using UHRP with blockchain timestamping
- **File Organization** - Create folders and manage your file catalog
- **Encryption Support** - Optional file encryption for privacy
- **Flexible Retention** - Choose storage duration with renewal options
- **Export/Import Catalog** - Backup and restore your file catalog
- **UHRP URLs** - Content-addressed links ensure file integrity
- **Multiple Storage Options** - Choose between UHRP or on-chain storage

**Target Users:** Anyone needing secure, decentralized file storage - developers, content creators, businesses, and individuals who want true ownership of their digital files without relying on centralized cloud providers.

## 2. Before You Begin

### Prerequisites
- **BSV Wallet:** BRC-100 compatible wallet (BSV Desktop or another BRC-100 wallet recommended)
- **Web Browser:** Modern browser with JavaScript enabled
- **BSV Balance:** Small amount of BSV for storage fees (varies by file size and retention period)

### Supported Platforms
- **Web-based:** Access via https://dropblocks.org/
- **Cross-platform:** Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **No Installation Required:** Pure web application

### Wallet Setup
If you don't have a BSV wallet yet, follow the [BSV Desktop Onboarding Guide](../metanet-desktop-mainnet.md) to get started. Make sure your wallet is running and funded before using DropBlocks.

## 4. Advanced Features

### Storage Options
- **UHRP Storage:** Files stored off-chain with UHRP URLs for decentralized access
- **On-Chain Storage:** Files written directly to BSV blockchain (best for small files)

### File Encryption
- Enable encryption during upload for sensitive files
- Encrypted files require your key for access
- Provides additional privacy layer beyond blockchain security

### UHRP URLs
- Each file gets a unique UHRP URL (e.g., `uhrp://...`)
- UHRP URLs are content-addressed and verifiable
- Share URLs for decentralized file access
- URLs work across UHRP-compatible applications

### Catalog Management
- **Export Catalog:** Download JSON file with all file references
- **Import Catalog:** Restore files list on new device
- Always export catalog backups regularly

## 5. Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Wallet not connecting | BSV wallet not running or incorrect host | Ensure wallet is running; check wallet host in Settings |
| Upload fails | Insufficient BSV balance | Add BSV to your wallet |
| File not accessible | File expired | Renew file before expiration or re-upload |
| Cannot see files | Catalog not imported | Import your catalog backup on new device |
| Payment confirmation pending | Blockchain confirmation delay | Wait for transaction confirmation (usually seconds) |

### Important Tips
- **Always backup files separately** - DropBlocks manages references, keep original files safe
- **Monitor expiration dates** - Set reminders to renew important files
- **Export catalog regularly** - Backup your catalog to avoid losing file references
- **Use encryption for sensitive data** - Add extra privacy layer for confidential files

### Getting Help
- **Community:** BSV blockchain community forums
- **Documentation:** Check DropBlocks website for updates
