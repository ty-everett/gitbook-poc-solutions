## 1. What Is Meter?

Meter is a blockchain-based counter application that enables you to create, increment, and decrement persistent counters (meters) tied to your BSV identity. Each meter maintains its state on the BSV blockchain, providing tamper-proof tracking of numerical values with full transparency and auditability. Whether tracking personal goals, managing inventory, monitoring events, or implementing reputation systems, Meter provides a simple yet powerful tool for blockchain-based counting.

**Key Features:**
- **Persistent Counters** - Create unlimited meters that maintain state on blockchain
- **Identity-Linked** - Each meter is cryptographically tied to your BSV identity key
- **Increment/Decrement Operations** - Simple +/- controls for adjusting values
- **Visual Feedback** - Real-time display of meter values and changes
- **Blockchain Verification** - All state changes recorded transparently on BSV
- **Multiple Meters** - Create and manage different meters for various purposes
- **Immutable History** - Complete audit trail of all counter changes

**Target Users:** Anyone needing reliable, transparent counting or tracking - gamification developers, task trackers, inventory managers, reputation system builders, habit trackers, event counters, or anyone requiring verifiable numerical state management on blockchain.

## 2. Before You Begin

### Prerequisites
- **BSV Wallet:** BSV Desktop Wallet or BRC-100 compatible wallet
- **BSV Identity:** Identity key for meter ownership and state management
- **Web Browser:** Modern browser with JavaScript enabled
- **BSV Balance:** Small amount for blockchain transaction fees (typically minimal)

### Supported Platforms
- **Web-based:** Access via https://meter.bapp.dev/
- **Cross-platform:** Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **BSV SDK Integration:** Built on BSV wallet and identity infrastructure for identity management
- **No Installation Required:** Pure web application

### Understanding Meter Concepts
Before creating your first meter, understand these key concepts:

**Meter:** A named counter with a current value, owner identity, and blockchain history

**State:** The current numerical value of a meter at any given time

**Increment:** Increase the meter value by a specified amount (default: 1)

**Decrement:** Decrease the meter value by a specified amount (default: 1)

**Identity Key:** Your BSV identity that owns and controls your meters

**Blockchain Persistence:** All meter changes are recorded as blockchain transactions

## 3. Getting Started: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Access Meter
1. Navigate to **https://meter.bapp.dev/** in your web browser
2. The Meter application interface loads
3. Ensure your BSV Desktop Wallet is running in the background
4. The app automatically detects your BRC-100 compatible wallet

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet
1. Meter requests permission to connect to your wallet
2. **Grant permission** in BSV Desktop when prompted
3. Your identity key is linked to the Meter application
4. The main dashboard appears showing any existing meters
5. Your identity status displays as "Connected"

**First Time Users:** If this is your first visit, the dashboard will be empty - ready for you to create your first meter.

### Step 3: Create Your First Meter
1. Locate the **"Create Meter"** button on the dashboard
2. Click to open the meter creation dialog
3. Enter a **name for your meter**:
   - Choose descriptive names (e.g., "Daily Tasks", "Inventory Count", "Points")
   - Names help you identify meters when managing multiple counters
4. Optionally set an **initial value** (default: 0)
5. Click **"Create"** or **"Confirm"**
6. BSV Desktop prompts for transaction approval
7. **Approve the blockchain transaction** (small fee)
8. Wait for blockchain confirmation (typically seconds)
9. Your new meter appears on the dashboard

**Naming Tips:**
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Consider adding context (e.g., "2025 Gym Visits" vs just "Gym")
- Avoid special characters that might cause display issues
- Keep names reasonably short for easy viewing

### Step 4: Increment Your Meter
1. Find your meter on the dashboard
2. Locate the **"+"** (plus/increment) button
3. Click to increase the meter value
4. The interface shows the increment operation
5. Approve the blockchain transaction in BSV Desktop
6. Wait for confirmation (usually very fast)
7. Watch the meter value update in real-time
8. The new value is now permanently recorded on blockchain

**Common Increment Use Cases:**
- Completed tasks or activities
- Items added to inventory
- Points earned in a game
- Events attended
- Habits maintained (daily streak counter)

### Step 5: Decrement Your Meter
1. Select the meter you want to decrease
2. Locate the **"−"** (minus/decrement) button
3. Click to decrease the meter value
4. The operation requires blockchain confirmation
5. **Approve in BSV Desktop**
6. Wait for transaction confirmation
7. Meter value decreases and updates on screen
8. Change is recorded immutably on blockchain

**Common Decrement Use Cases:**
- Items removed from inventory
- Tasks unmarked or reversed
- Points spent or deducted
- Corrections to previous counts
- Decreasing availability counters

### Step 6: Manage Multiple Meters
1. Create additional meters using the "Create Meter" button
2. Each meter appears as a separate card or entry on dashboard
3. All meters display simultaneously with:
   - Meter name
   - Current value
   - Increment/decrement controls
   - Last updated timestamp (if shown)
4. Interact with each meter independently
5. All meters are tied to your identity key
6. Track different activities or quantities simultaneously

**Multi-Meter Strategies:**
- **Activity Tracking:** Different meters for different goals
- **Inventory Management:** Separate meters for different item types
- **Gamification:** Multiple point or achievement counters
- **Team Tracking:** Each team member maintains their own meters
- **Project Metrics:** Different metrics for project monitoring

## 5. Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Meter not incrementing | Blockchain confirmation pending | Wait 30-60 seconds for confirmation; avoid rapid clicking |
| Cannot create meter | Insufficient BSV balance | Add BSV to wallet to cover transaction fees |
| Meter value doesn't update | Page not refreshed | Refresh browser or wait for automatic update |
| Lost access to meters | Different identity key | Ensure using same wallet/identity as when meters were created |
| Transaction rejected | Network issue or fee too low | Retry operation; check network status; ensure adequate balance |
| Meters not loading | Wallet not connected | Reconnect BSV Desktop wallet; refresh page |

### Tips for Effective Use
- **Wait for Confirmation:** Don't click increment/decrement rapidly; wait for each transaction to confirm
- **Blockchain Awareness:** Each operation has a small cost and requires brief confirmation time
- **Identity Consistency:** Always use the same wallet/identity to maintain meter access
- **Regular Monitoring:** Check meters regularly to ensure values are as expected
- **Backup Identity:** Securely backup your identity key to prevent meter access loss
