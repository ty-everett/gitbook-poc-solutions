## 1. What Is CoolCert?

CoolCert is a playful yet functional identity certification system built on the BSV blockchain. It demonstrates how digital identity certificates can be issued and verified using blockchain-backed attestation. While the "cool" certificate is lighthearted, the underlying technology showcases real-world identity verification suitable for serious applications.

**Key Features:**
- **Digital Identity Certificates** - Issue blockchain-backed identity proofs
- **Blockchain Verification** - Cryptographically verifiable certificates
- **Integration Ready** - Use certificates with other BSV applications
- **API Access** - Programmatic certificate issuance and verification
- **Educational Example** - Learn blockchain identity concepts through hands-on experience
- **GitHub Documentation** - Open-source code for learning and development

**Target Users:** Developers learning blockchain identity systems, users needing identity verification for BSV applications like MarsCast, and anyone interested in decentralized identity proof-of-concept demonstrations.

## 2. Before You Begin

### Prerequisites
- **BSV Wallet:** BRC-100 compatible wallet (BSV Desktop or another BRC-100 wallet recommended)
- **Web Browser:** Modern browser with JavaScript enabled
- **BSV Balance:** Small amount of BSV for certificate issuance transaction

### Supported Platforms
- **Web-based:** Access via https://coolcert.babbage.systems/
- **Cross-platform:** Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **No Installation Required:** Pure web application
- **API Available:** Programmatic access for developers

### Understanding Digital Certificates
CoolCert demonstrates how blockchain-based identity certificates work:
- **Issuance:** Certificate is created and signed on BSV blockchain
- **Verification:** Anyone can verify authenticity using blockchain
- **Portability:** Use certificate across compatible applications
- **Immutability:** Certificate record cannot be altered or forged

## 3. Getting Started: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Access CoolCert
1. Navigate to **https://coolcert.babbage.systems/** in your web browser
2. Ensure your BSV Desktop wallet is running in the background
3. The main page displays the certificate dashboard

### Step 2: Issue Your CoolCert Certificate
1. Click **"Issue Certificate"** or **"Get CoolCert"** button
2. The system will connect to your BSV wallet
3. Review the certificate details:
   - Your identity key
   - Certificate type (officially "cool")
   - Blockchain timestamp
4. Confirm the small transaction fee in your wallet
5. Your certificate is issued and recorded on the blockchain

### Step 3: View Your Certificate
1. After issuance, your certificate appears in the dashboard
2. View certificate details:
   - Certificate ID
   - Issue date and blockchain height
   - Your identity information
   - Verification status
3. Share certificate ID with others for verification

### Step 4: Verify Certificates
1. Enter any certificate ID in the verification field
2. Click **"Verify"** to check blockchain records
3. System confirms:
   - Certificate validity
   - Issuer information
   - Timestamp and blockchain proof
4. Use this to verify certificates from others

### Step 5: Use Certificate with Other Apps
1. Many BSV applications require identity verification
2. Use your CoolCert for apps like [MarsCast](./MarsCast.md)
3. When prompted, provide your certificate ID
4. App verifies your identity via blockchain
5. Gain access to identity-restricted features

## 5. Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Unable to fetch certificate | Browser compatibility or network issue | Use latest browser version; check internet connection |
| Wallet not connecting | BSV Desktop not running | Launch BSV Desktop and ensure it's connected to mainnet |
| Certificate not appearing | Blockchain confirmation delay | Wait a few seconds for transaction confirmation; refresh page |
| Verification fails | Incorrect certificate ID | Double-check ID; ensure it's from valid CoolCert issuance |
| API not responding | Network or service issue | Check API status; verify endpoint URL is correct |
